Cronus
======

Cronus is an Open Source Multi-Tenant Virtualized, Platform as a Service
(PaaS) solution.

It is backed by many hours of R&D by Thinkcube. Cronus aims to bring cost
effective scalability to Cloud Computing, viable for Telco environments.
The unique multi-tenant virtualization enables much lower “per customer”
deployment cost than traditional PaaS solutions.

Cronus consists of 3 main components:
# Tenants
# Proxy
# DNS Controller

Some of the included features of the platform are:
- Apache virtualization
- PHP support
- MySQL-Multi support
- Tenant management
- SAML Identity Provider
- PHP SAML Service Provider
- LVM based storage

More information with developer resources and community links will be
available soon.

Since Thinkcube is in the process of releasing Cronus as an Open Source
project, production use is not recommended for the moment. Trying out
and contributing is always welcome though.

Current supported platforms: Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS (64-bit)
